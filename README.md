# TQD_Overlay

This code is the just the frontend portion of a Rocket League overlay for streaming. It requires a server that also communicates with the SOS-Plugin for BakkesMod in Rocket League.

Currently it uses the Rocket Socket by scallensc. Found here: https://gitlab.com/scallensc1/rocketsocket

Planning to fully integrate the SOS-Plugin websocket with my frontend and turn it into an Electron app.
